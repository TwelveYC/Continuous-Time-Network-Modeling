This work is review of the paper  
TIE-DECAY TEMPORAL NETWORKS IN CONTINUOUS TIME
AN EIGENVECTOR-BASED CENTRALITIE
Focus on continuous time complex network model, and prepare for next work.  
I have realized continuous time network model.You can use exponent ,exponent_cutoff and constant three ways to decay network weight.  
 ## Dataset
 The dataset if from  Stanford university complex network lab.  
 ## How to use it
 you can use config.py to control this continuous time network decay process.including dataset ,decay way and parameter.  
 ##Detail
 In network's run function ,it's a generator, you can get any data in process by yourself
